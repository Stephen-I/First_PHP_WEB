      <p class="py-3">
        In the beginning, the six gods of legend created everything. The four elemental gods; Fire, Water, Earth and Wind combined their powers to create the waking world and its inhabitants the Humans, the Elves, the Giants, the Dwarfs and the Celestials. The races were split across the supercontinent of the fell pioneers, to the east the might of the Giants with their unparalleled strength. To the west were the elves with their naturally high incarnate levels and research. To the North were the stalwart dwarves with their expertise in the arts. And lastly the Humans with no unique attributes made their home on a small continent to the south known as Kizenthia. The gods placed three masses or power across the lands. One in the West, one to the North and one on Kizenthia, these masses of power were soon known as world gems. The one to the west was claimed by the elves to which they built a strong civilisation surrounding it to study incarnate energy. The world gem on Kizenthia was claimed by the humans which also gave them access to the art. And the third was lost to the wild unable to be utilised by the Giants or Dwarves. The gods of light and dark didn’t agree with the elemental gods that all the races should live in the same domain for their power was to great and it would cause chaos so the individual races of celestials they created were given dimensions of their own to preside one for the angels and one for the demons. There were four primal elemental spirits created in the image of each elemental god to preside over the spirits but as the light and dark gods predicted these elementals were too powerful to live among humans. Their power shifted conditions of the very world itself to match their element, making it inhospitable. To solve the problem the light and dark gods came together once again and combined their power to create a spirit of balance and peace known as Titania. She took command of the spirits as their queen and used her dimensional abilities to transport them all to their own realms to rule over which allowed the humans to thrive. But with actions come consequence and as a result of Titania’s creation another being was also created. One of pure chaos and destruction, the Demiurge. He craved destruction like no other to the point where he shattered the fragile relationship between the different species and instigated what came to be known as the first Celestial war between Humans, Demon and Angels. This great war ravaged the lands and caused the fall of many lives, most severely the Dragons. They were divided between their alliances of races and in the aftermath only a few remained. To stop all this, the god granted Titania with a relic. A book capable of sealing the demiurge away. So in response the queen of spirits sought out her brother and they fought for what seemed like days, but with the help of the various celestials Titania came out on top and trapped her brother in the book, never to be heard from again. This put an end to the fighting and the war was over. But chaos doesn’t just disappear and the races have been on edge ever since.

      <h1 class="font-bold py-3">Lore of Kizenthia</h1>
      <p class="py-3">
        Originally giants ruled their own kingdom on The Fell Pioneers, using humans for manual labour. But one day a human got tired of it, and in secret plotted to assassinate the king of giants and usurp throne in turn removing the giants from power. But the plot failed and the king survived. As a result the king of Giants exiled the Humans to Kizenthia the neighbouring land. When Humans first got there the land was plentiful and Fauna was many. The humans settled down and built small towns. These towns turned to cities to kingdoms. As a result the first Kingdom of Calphicorn was established. Slowly but surely the humans spread further across the land establishing new kingdoms and discovering new places until kizenthia became what it is now. The kingdoms thrived and wildlife flourished. But there was one anomaly  in all this peace. It was known as the black dragon Enchirodon. It was a powerful being that thrived off of chaos and destruction. One day while this dragon was going on a rampage, it angered the gods, and as a result was struck down with divine retribution but this act drained the gods of most of their power so they ceased interaction with the mortal plain to recuperate. Its corpse slowly degenerated and hardened to form a black crystal at the centre of the world. This crystal was a powerful source of incarnate energy. And as man has always fought to gain power, war broke out over control of this crystal. Although unknown to all, as the black dragon thrived of chaos, the corrupted crystal fed off of the humans anger and hate for each other only to grow in power to the point that the crystal couldn’t contain it all and the resulting explosion shattered the crystal, sending black shards surging with power across the realm. The areas that these shards landed in created areas of unstable energy called power spots in which any organism caught in the spot either devolved into ghouls from over energy saturation or evolved to create the various races of demi humans. The final and largest of the fragments created descendants of the Enchirodon himself, known as the dragon kin, a race of demi humans able to utilize ancient draconic abilities. Along with the crystal shards, a fragment of the Gods weapon used to smite Enchirodon was launched across the land and landed at the isle of Nuju. Due to its excess positive energy, a mass amount of over growth occurred turning the Isle of Nuju into a paradise of plant life where Titania queen of the spirits came to inhabit and defend the relic from intruders wishing to abuse the power of the fragment. Over time the remain power spots dissipated and the energy contained in them seeped into the earth and created incarnate crystals. These were an inferior version of what the elves accomplished, that get burned out after a short amount of time. The humans utilized these for temporary explosive boost in power.

      <p class="py-3">
      The Elves, with their advanced know how of Incarnate energy discovered a way to improve their Incarnate abilities to allow them to drastically increase their natural capacity and control. They used the power of the world gem to create smaller crystals to which they would implant in their foreheads, allowing them to by-pass their natural limits. The elves that went through this process came to be know as high elves. And with this discovery they were no longer shackled. But the Giants were Conquerors, they surged across the land, burning town after town, taking one territory after another. They subjugated the dwarves and forced them to make powerful tools to help further their conquest. One being a certain mineral that can be used to counteract Incarnate energy itself. With this invention to which they called a null stone, the giants stormed the elven capital and in the process destroyed the world gem there. Although this move crippled the elven civilisation they were not helpless for the high elves were able to still utilize their enhanced powers to an extent but it wasn’t enough. Using the null stone to weaken them, the giants beat back the elves and took most of them prisoner and sealed their magic using null stones. The elven civilisation fell, and the giants took control of the Fell Pioneers. After an uprising of human slaves within the ranks of the Giants. The humans were banished to live on the deserted continent of Kizenthia but somehow prospered and now, 400yrs later after the after the banishment the giants have set their gaze upon Kizenthia as their next target to plunder.
