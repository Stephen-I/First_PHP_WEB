      <h1 class="font-bold py-3">Discover the incarnate weapons of legend</h1>
      <p>I always had a love for myths and legends abouts gods and legendary weapons and such so I decided to incorperate them into this world I created with a little spin off from the real world lore based around the lore of Kizenthia</p>
      <h2 class="font-bold py-3">Dainsleif</h2>
      <p>
        There are many iterations of the sword Dainsleif, but the main generalised idea is that it is a cursed sword that once drawn, it has a thirst that can only be quenched by blood. Using this as basis I came up with the following lore for my world. 
      </p>
      <p class="py-3">
        Originally was a regular sword but during the second celestial war, was in fused with Dragon fire to give it purifying abilities, but in the first battle against Enchirodon, it ended up absorbing a lot of malicious energy, therefore transforming it into the cursed sword Dainsleif which thirst for the blood of its enemies.
      </p>
      <h2 class="font-bold py-3">Laevateinn</h2>
      <p>
        I have read that Laevateinn was known as the sun like sword or that its abilities were to conjure fire in battle so that inspired me to adapt it as such in Kizenthia. I came up with the following description as a result.
      </p>
      <p class="py-3">
        A sword that was infused with the power of the spirit of Fire Laevaitein in order to split apart the Angel-Demon hybrid for their protection. This sword took on the name of the spirit it was bonded to.</p>
      <h2 class="font-bold py-3">Ame no Habakiri</h2>
      <p>
        In lore, many gods owned a sword of this type known as a Totsuka-no-Tsurugi, otherwise called sword of ten Hand-breaths. One of these aforementioned swords was known as the Ame no Habakiri. This sword was the sword that Susanoo used to slay the serpent Orochi. I created the following world lore in response to these facts.
      </p>
      <p class="py-3">
        It was the sword originally used Titania to defeat and seal Demiurge during the first celestial war but was soon after lost to the ravages of time until it was found by the current wielder Saveron.
      </p>
      <h2 class="font-bold py-3">Hakaishin</h2>
      <p>
        I created this last weapon slightly differently to the rest. It was not a weapon wielded by gods in lore but rather it was a term that directly translates to God of destruction. I found this rather fitting for the origin of this weapon in Kizenthia so I decided to call it that. The following lore describes my thoughts. 
      </p>
      <p class="py-3">
        After Demiurge was defeated for the second time he was sealed within a gem and watched over by his sister Titania but was later stolen by elves and used to create Hakaishin. A scythe that wielded the same destructive power as the demi-god it was made from.
